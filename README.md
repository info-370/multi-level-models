# Multi-level Models
This learning module introduces **Multi-level models** as a method for modeling _nested data_. Because GitHub Markdown [doesn't support](https://github.com/github/markup/issues/897) rendering equations, the module is in the [module.pdf](module.pdf) document, which was generated using the [module.Rmd](module.Rmd) file.

To execute a simplified example of the analysis discussed throughout the module, run the [faculty-data.R](faculty-data.R) file.
